                                Brick Break is a game  in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle.
                                The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the BlackBerry's trackwheel, the computer's mouse or the touch of a finger
                                (in the case of touchscreen). When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new level.
                                There are many versions of brick breaker, some in which you can shoot flaming fireballs or play with more than one ball if the player gets a power up.

                                The Brick Breaker which was originally called the Breakout was developed in 1976.
                                In the late 70's computers were only available for the universities and only for studies, therefore the first brick breaker game was created as an arcade game.
                                The big change came in 2007 when brick breaker was released. Brick Breaker is the first game that was created for the cell phone platform- BlackBerry. The Brick Breaker was record-breaking in sales.
                                The Brick Breaker has re-founded the Breakout style genre, In fact, many people think that the brick breaker is the original name of this genre. Simultaneously, as the internet evolved many breakout style games were uploaded to the internet and the fast successful of the brick breaker promoted it as well.
